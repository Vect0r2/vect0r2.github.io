<p>The <b>Confederated League of Independent Planets</b> (shortened to <b>CLIP</b>, and originally <b>the Colonial Militia</b>) is a group of colonies, originating from <a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Zohil&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Zohil (page does not exist)">the United Republics of Free Zohil,</a> that are banded together to form a sovereign nation. While the League was initially formed as a planetary defense force from deserters, it has since been remolded into a somewhat coherent government.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Structure">Structure</span></h2>
<p>The League is a militarized, decentralized government. It divides its primary responsibilities into divisions.
</p>
<h3><span id="The_CLIP_Minutemen_.28C-MM.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="The_CLIP_Minutemen_(C-MM)">The CLIP Minutemen (C-MM)</span></h3>
<p>The military arm of the Confederated League of Independent Planets is the <b>CLIP Minutemen</b>. Sometimes nicknamed <i>"Blueberries"</i> for their steel blue uniforms and helmets, the C-MM is in charge of all defensive and offensive military strategy within CLIP. The name Minutemen comes from <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#The_Frontiersman_War">a wartime story of a pirate ship that got shot down in a single minute</a>, and not, despite popular belief, from militias ready at a minute's notice.
</p>
<h4><span id="The_Galactic_Optimum_Labor_Division_.28CLIP-GOLD.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Galactic_Optimum_Labor_Division_(CLIP-GOLD)">The Galactic Optimum Labor Division (CLIP-GOLD)</span></h4>
<p>A division formed during the stint of the Unknown Threats Division, the <b>Galactic Optimum Labor Division</b> is a regulatory body designed to ensure colonial autarky, as well as draw funding for the CLIP's governmental branches. GOLD's role in the League covers law enforcement, border control and tax collection. Almost every planet in CLIP space has a GOLD office on it.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Divisions">Divisions</span></h3>
<h4><span id="Biohazard_Assessment_and_Removal_Division_.28CLIP-BARD.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Biohazard_Assessment_and_Removal_Division_(CLIP-BARD)">Biohazard Assessment and Removal Division (CLIP-BARD)</span></h4>
<p>Originating in FS 422 as the Unknown Threats Division, the UTD researched and fought xenofauna, before rechristening itself as the <b>Biohazard Assessment and Removal Division</b>. Initially dedicated to the research and removal of Xenofauna, BARD is now also concerned with the protection of the health and safety of the League's population, especially in the biological hazard front. 
</p>
<h4><span id="Legal_Oversight_and_Regulation_Division_.28CLIP-LORD.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Legal_Oversight_and_Regulation_Division_(CLIP-LORD)">Legal Oversight and Regulation Division (CLIP-LORD)</span></h4>
<p><b>LORD</b> is the civil and legal regulatory organ of the Confederated League. Their line of work ranges from covering rights and responsibilities of citizens to elaboration of conventions and settling land or ownership disputes between colonies. They are not law enforcement - they only handle judicial matters.
</p>
<h4><span id="Legislative_Agricultural_Notation_Division_.28CLIP-LAND.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Legislative_Agricultural_Notation_Division_(CLIP-LAND)">Legislative Agricultural Notation Division (CLIP-LAND)</span></h4>
<p>After the conflict with the Frontiersmen pirate fleet, a commission was formed in order to coordinate colony development, including the pivotal agricultural sector. Eventually, this commission formed into <b>LAND</b>, which branched out its work into colony infrastructure and social welfare.
</p>
<h4><span id="Materiel_Engineering_and_Leasing_Division_.28CLIP-MELD.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Materiel_Engineering_and_Leasing_Division_(CLIP-MELD)">Materiel Engineering and Leasing Division (CLIP-MELD)</span></h4>
<p>The origin of <b>MELD</b> lies within the factories of Lanchester City, which manufactured much of the military hardware in use by CLIP in the modern day. Their job is to ensure that the League has the material they need, along with standardized designs and sustainable workplaces. They are often found assisting other divisions with engineering aid.
</p>
<h4><span id="Drug_Evaluation_and_Enhancement_Division_.28CLIP-DEED.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Drug_Evaluation_and_Enhancement_Division_(CLIP-DEED)">Drug Evaluation and Enhancement Division (CLIP-DEED)</span></h4>
<p><b>DEED's</b> focus lies on the research, development and creation of medicine, though shares common ground with the healthcare sector in the Confederated League.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Culture">Culture</span></h2>
<ul><li>The history of armed conflict within the League has led them to possess the <b>highest civilian-to-military personnel ratio of any faction</b>. While this is for historical reasons, the League knows this, and has favored service as a way to <a href="#Playing_a_member_of_this_faction">meet other people within the league</a>. As a result, the culture on federal or Minutemen ships can range from formal to extremely casual (much to the dismay of PGF advisors). Despite this however, CLIP vessels tend to be as competent as other factions in combat situations. Their casual demeanor also leads to bonds occurring between crew members with more ease than in other factions, and crew members display a tendency to become lifelong friends.</li>
<li>Exaggerated and unrealistic pirate costumes may be popular or innocuous in most of the known galaxy, but are considered offensive in the founding colonies of the League. It is not uncommon to <b>see armed citizens or Minutemen suddenly fire upon those wearing Frontiersmen or Ramzi uniforms on sight</b> with no warning.</li>
<li>Because of the nature of the League's decentralized alliance, <b>members of the League lack a unified culture</b>, instead resorting to locally developed customs. Their culture is<a href="#Playing_a_member_of_this_faction"> so varied it is not possible to list it all here. See the <b>Playing a member of this faction</b> section to see each planet's unique culture.</a> The lack of a unifying culture is a major disadvantage in the face of encroaching soft power from places such as <a href="Kalixcis.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Kalixcis">Kalixcis</a>.
<ul><li>Despite this, a few cultural touchstones have transcended barriers, and have spread across the league. While these are not the only cultural touchstones in CLIP, these are the few that have crossed the boundaries of each confederated member, and are popular in all of CLIP short of recently-joined planets:
<ul><li><b>RZNET</b>: An early Zohil-era communications network intended for rapid communication between military units stationed on the frontier. Following the URFZ's retreat, access was opened to the public due to the impending danger. While its intended purpose was to rapidly transmit defensive plans and updates to civilians, it developed its own culture and united the early Colonial Militia. Several posts have gained notoriety due their unusual nature coinciding with historical moments, including the infamous 'jumpdrive cables' post. It was shut down in FS 423 after obvious security flaws came to light, including poor moderation tools and necessitating the newly formed League to moderate it, whereas recently developed planetary internet outclassed it. Many today disagree with the decision as it meant that CLIP would be left without an Intranet until decades later, regarded as a reason for CLIP's poor cultural meshing.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Star_City&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Star City (page does not exist)">Time Marches Ever On</a></b>: A show based on the novel <i>"Time Waits For Nobody"</i> involving a fantasy setting based on <a href="Pan-Gezena_Federation.html#Bezuts_Systemary_War" title="Pan-Gezena Federation">Zale-Era Kalixcis</a>. While starting off tricking the believer to believe it is an adventure show, it kills off what it lures the viewer to believe is the main character by the end of the first episode, and reveals itself to be a political/military drama with a constant focus on the concept of time, with characters aging as time goes on. Notably, the show throws a twist where the novel ends with the narrator being implied to freeze to death in a cliffhanger ending. Instead, the show continues after the cliffhanger, showing that the narrator in fact discovers how to use a plant's energy to create a fire by accidentally spilling a potion on it, surviving and later inventing a laser musket to take on the people who betrayed them. The advancing of time with technology rather than tech staying the same has come to be one of the series' most prevalent and iconic traits.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Ryunosuke&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ryunosuke (page does not exist)">Sweet New Life</a></b>: A novel based on the founder of Ryunosuke's own experiences coming out of retirement after decades to visit the capital, he claims the city has transformed into an alien urban landscape unlike what he remembered. It combines a love for life, along with humor to create a touching story, filled with historical facts, and both criticism and praises of modern life, agreeing that life now is better than before. A famous remark made by the author was seeing people living so comfortably made him "[...] feel as if my life was worth something.".</li>
<li><b><a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Serene&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Serene (page does not exist)">Zeir 'ar Shar!</a></b>: A comic that starts off as a comedy on the first colonization attempts with the protagonist being being a extremely patrotic Zohil at first, usually suffering in comedic ways, before the story continues and pivots to something more akin to her finding family, and realizing that there is more to life than serving one's country. The story ends with the protagonist looking back at all she has helped to build, before an out-of-place spacer equipped with EVA gear remarks about how the planet is so cold and that nobody would live here, a nod to the story's comedic tone early on. Critics who consider the protagonist's behavior 'cute' early on usually dislike the shift in tone, and comment on the conflicting themes.</li>
<li><b><a href="Maxin.html" title="Maxin">Nefi Mifime</a></b>: An animated show where a <a href="Kepori.html" title="Kepori">Kepori</a> migrant from the <a href="The_Unified_Teceti_Federation.html#Southern_Teceti_Combine" title="The Unified Teceti Federation">Southern Teceti Combine</a> migrates to Lanchester due to their Mother's business, and has to adjust to life there. This story, unlike the tales previously mentioned, have no underlying subtext to them, created as a simplistic Slice of Life story that would later become one of the most popular stories to come from the Confederated League's territory. Watchers tend to fall into three categories: bewildered that it is as popular as it is, consume it in a rather casual fashion and is taken by surprise when someone discusses it, or they may be a dedicated fan of the media. If a citizen of CLIP doesn't know about it, they are certainly aware of the polarizing discussion over the media's faithfulness.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Relations">Relations</span></h2>
<p>Relations with other factions often differ depending on the member planet, but in general:
</p>
<ul><li>The <a href="Pan-Gezena_Federation.html" title="Pan-Gezena Federation">Pan-Gezena Federation</a> is <b>allied</b> with the League due to various political and historical reasons, primarily being the opposition to the Explorat.
<ul><li>The long nature of this alliance makes friendship between soldiers to be common. Officers and leaders of both sides, however, are still mildly wary of each other.</li></ul></li></ul>

<li><b>FS 10</b>
<ul><li>The space race continued, up until when Bezuts was so well explored that the loss of momentum instead caused tensions between both powers. This is widely regarded as the precursor to the Bezuts Systemary War.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 35-38</b>
<ul><li>Bezuts Systemary War. PGF Victory.</li>
<li>Despite the Republic's crippled military due to their the Bezuts Systemary War, it still had a massive advantage in external affairs: their very good relationship with <a href="Riso-Teceti.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Riso-Teceti">Riso-Teceti</a></li>
<li>Following the war effort by the URFZ, their space agency is put into developing the first bluespace drive to finally meet Tecetians in person - which not only beats the PGF by a landslide, but also extends the advantage the URFZ has over the PGF.</li>
<li>As bluespace technology was developed, the URFZ would soon gain the advantage in trading, as they were generally on good terms with Riso-Teceti.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 150</b>
<ul><li>A colonization frenzy had overtaken every nation in the Kalixcis system, and while the PGF had more mass to show with their massive advances in colonization and military standing, the URFZ's flourishing economy and resource production was more valuable in this regard.</li>
<li>The Federation's reputation had been improving, as their projection of power was easier to see than the URFZ's advantage, and many Zohilians felt as if their government was being 'lazy' in colonizing. While the URFZ was putting in effort into colonizing, the government was in reality waiting for the right moment, and the right moment came in FS-250</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Operation_NanoColonies">Operation <i>NanoColonies</i></span></h3>
<ul><li><b>FS 250</b>
<ul><li>While the PGF were the first to make contact with the <a href="Most_Serene_Solar_and_Intersolar_Confederation.html" title="Most Serene Solar and Intersolar Confederation">Most Serene Solar and Intersolar Confederation</a> , the URFZ wasted no time in taking advantage of the moment.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 280</b>
<ul><li>Private investors greenlight a venture with Solarian investors to create <a href="Nanotrasen.html" title="Nanotrasen">Nanotrasen</a>.</li>
<li>Trouble quickly found the newly formed Telecommunications Firm, however, as Etherbor Industries quickly made it virtually impossible to do business within PGF territory, severely limiting their buisness prospects.</li>
<li>Nanotrasen Investors turned to the Zohil Government for help, and an agreement was reached which encompassed the URFZ's plans for not only a massive show of power, but also a profitable one as well, called <b>Operation <i>NanoColonies</i></b>.</li>
<li>The improvements in bluespace techs meant that a region of space previously ignored and rich in Plasma and close to the shoal called the Frontier was expected to be the colonization target. While the PGF was busy drawing up plans, the URFZ was already at work.</li>
<li>As apart of Operation NanoColonies, Zohil would work together with <a href="Riso-Teceti.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Riso-Teceti">Riso-Teceti</a> to rapidly colonize the frontier by a quick but efficient deployment of Teceti's Terraforming corporations, then a colonization team would be sent, and afterwards, Nanotrasen contractors would be sent to build communications infrastructure, along with relocating their headquarters to the colonies once work was finished.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 291</b>
<ul><li>The plan had succeeded far beyond anyone's expectations. Not only were such a massive amount of worlds colonized in such a short amount of time, but Nanotrasen had invented the cutting-edge stock part system during the project, which not only made them extremely more efficent, but made the planet they were given to headquarters in extremely prosperous, and made the investors rich, along with absolutely humiliating the PGF right in front of the Solarians who they so recently contacted.</li>
<li>This region of space would be called the Zohil NanoColonies territory, later renamed Nanotrasen Core Worlds.</li>
<li>Due to Nanotrasen's extreme success, Nanotrasen would purchase colonies surrounding Zohil's core colony for private use.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 300-350</b>
<ul><li>The PGF was starting to colonize the frontier at a reasonable speed, yet Zohil was still extremely far ahead, and has started colonizing the "Zohil Outer Frontier".</li>
<li>The same Operation NanoColonies strategy was used, though progress was slower due to low prioritization.</li>
<li>SolCon's influence over Nanotrasen pressured Nanotrasen to avoid this wave of colonization, though it only managed to slow down the process, not stop it.</li>
<li>Luna-Town was chosen as a base of operations, and the previously colonized Ryunosuke was integrated quickly.</li>
<li>The Zohil Outer Frontier region does very well for itself, not only being well developed, but also being close to the now mega-corporation Nanotrasen.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Explorat-Militia_War">Explorat-Militia War</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>FS 365</b>
<ul><li>Zohil was now awash with political instability. Accusations of corruption and incompetency along with radically different factions with different ideas on how the government would be run, along with a galactic recession, would lie the seeds for the Zohil revolution and civil war.</li>
<li>The URFZ would slowly retreat the military stationed at the Zohil Outer Frontier, leaving the colonies within undefended.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 372</b>
<ul><li>By the time of the projected "temporarily military withdraw" date, morale was at an all-time low, to the point that Zohil vessels and personnel started to desert to stay with the colonies, refusing to head into the Republic's civil war. The deserters would later self-title themselves as the <b>Militia First Fleet.</b></li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 378</b></li>
<li>As the dust settled and it became clear that the <b>Zohil Explorat</b> was now in control, the Explorat's intent to take back the colonies did not go unnoticed; officers and colony leaders alike quickly scrambled for a plan to defend themselves against a significantly larger force.
<ul><li>While the First Fleet had retrieved arms from the deserting forces, it was determined that resisting an invasion from the Explorat would require a more extensive arming and a conscription of citizens - especially since Nanotrasen had refused to support colonial military efforts. The lack of adequate funding for the colonies made it difficult to acquire arms from established manufacturers, prompting the Fleet to obtain and reverse engineer the recently colonized Illestren's arms, while also focusing on cheap, high-power weapons in order to deal with Zohil's thicker armor, most famously the SKM rifle. Arms of this era were produced in such numbers that they are still circulated on the black market.</li>
<li>Aid was requested from the PGF, but not only was the Federation busy with putting down their own rebellion nearby, the First Fleet was vocally against this. Therefore, the PGF only found it appropriate to send advisors for training purposes.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS-390</b></li>
<li>The Explorat had completely consolidated control, defeated all opposition, and at last, its Naval Forces returned to reclaim the Frontier colonies. While the colonies were sure they would never last a prolonged conflict, they had also made sure that while the Explorat would absolutely suffer while doing so. The resulting conflict would last less than a year.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>FS-391</b></li>
<li>The Explorat had completely failed in reclaiming the colonies due to their loyal forces being severely exhausted and under supplied from the civil war, but also Zohil military units that were inherited from the republic were severely demoralized by the shift in power.
<ul><li>Realizing that this conflict would take longer than expected and also waste resources better spent on recovering after the civil war, the leaders of the Explorat would finally withdraw, for good this time.</li>
<li>The colonies and First Fleet held against an overwhelming force, but at a tremendous cost. While the Explorat may have suffered from severe issues which prevented their success, they were still much better equipped technologically than the colonies, and many milita personnel and equipment were killed or destroyed.</li></ul></li>
<li>After this, what remained of the first fleet and local colonial forces agreed on unifying, creating an alliance named the <b>Colonial Militia.</b> All members of the Colonial Militia would later be the founding members of the Colonial League.
<ul><li>The Zohil Explorat, defeated and humiliated, removes its capital from Kalixcis, and takes an isolationist policy on the rest of the galaxy. While the Explorat-Militia War wasn't the only reason, <a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Zohil&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Zohil (page does not exist)">it's the only one relevant to this article</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>Unfortunately, chance would not be kind to the newly formed militia, as an ambitious pirate fleet happened to emerge from the shoal just 10 years prior, and had taken noticed of the severely weakened colonies.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Frontiersman_War">The Frontiersman War</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>FS-392</b>
<ul><li>Pirates, taking advantage of the now-weakened stance of these colonies, rapidly sprung up in the region, and had begun conducting extensive raids on colonies, notably the <a href="Frontiersmen.html" title="Frontiersmen">Old Frontiersmen</a>.
<ul><li>The Frontiersmen had made a name for themselves by a particularly brutal strategy of attacking other pirates, executing the leadership, and keeping the crew alive to expand their fleet. The sheer amount of manpower available to the fleet had begun intimidating pirate captains began to join the Frontiersmen.</li>
<li>The militias, while adequate at staving off small pirate crews, were completely overwhelmed by the massive and mostly-organized Frontiersmen pirate fleet.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS-395</b>
<ul><li>During a particularly intense raid, the militia of <a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Radinska&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Radinska (page does not exist)">Radinska</a> is wiped out following a coordinated pirate flank on the populated areas of the colony.</li>
<li>Captain Rawkkriiiehkhaka, rather than ransacking the colony, decides to seize control.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS-396</b>
<ul><li>Following a streak of defeats and losses for the colonies, the Luna-Town militia, desperate and severely lacking in supplies, had struck gold while looking for salvage to employ in the defensive effort.
<ul><li>A vessel, seemingly plain scrap, was located, and within it a large cache of equipment, including multiple, extremely-old yet intact models of P16s, blue ballistic helmets with white markings, and miscellaneous materiel and training documents were encountered by the team. The vessel’s markings had long faded away, making the vessel’s origin a mystery, but it was later called the <i>UNSV Lichtenstein</i> by various colonists.</li></ul></li>
<li>Later that year, two Frontiersmen cruisers are sent to attempt to wipe out and potentially capture the planet.
<ul><li>Due to the various victories achieved by the fleet previously and the poor equipment of previously encountered Colonial Militia, the cruisers attempts a confident lighting attack towards the colony.</li>
<li>The popular Battle of Luna-Town lasted about 3 hours, from the landing of the vessel to the retreat of the second ship. Following the cruiser's landing and an interrupted march into Luna-Town, an urban ambush by Militia forces catch the pirate line off-guard. Usage of the equipment found on the <i>UNSV Lichtenstein</i> created a massive advantage for the defending forces.</li>
<li>After the Militia on Luna-Town wins a decisive victory and seizes the landed pirate ship, CLIP's accounts of the battle claims that the Frontiersmen that were evacuated to the other cruiser in orbit were shot down in, roughly, a minute. News of this victory spread far and wide throughout the colonies, granting some hope to the besieged. Hoping to still catch the pirates off guard, the Planet of <a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Lanchester_City&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lanchester City (page does not exist)">Lanchester City</a> is retaken by colonial forces.</li>
<li>The term “Minutemen” was coined after the highly-inspiring story of the pirate ship that got shot down in a single minute, and not after militias ready at a minute's notice.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>FS-402</b>
<ul><li>After replicating and distributing the newly found equipment, the Luna-Town Militia becomes a major player in the war, removing many planets and colonies from control of the Frontiersmen fleet.</li></ul></li></ul>

<li><i>You ever see mobile suit gundam 79? It was kinda like that, but with less mechs and infantry/naval combat.</i></li>
<li>From a military standpoint but quickly so we don't bore the people who don't care about that:
<ul><li>The Old Frontiersmen were unprepared for a Milita recovery, and their high morale due to the rapid chain of victories. Furthermore, the Frontiersmen fleet were specialized in quick hit-and-run operations, requiring mobility and momentum, which ultimately led to their eventual demise.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>FS-412:</b>
<ul><li>The final remainders of the Frontiersmen are confronted in their sector of operations. By this time, the fleet had been driven to exhaustion via an extensive siege, and remaining forces had begun deserting the fleet. A rather anti-climatic final attack landed the final nail in the coffin for the Frontiersmen. Captain Rawkkriiiehkhaka would be killed on the FFV Rawkkriiiehkhaka, and sadly the answers to the many mysteries of the Frontiersmen would go along with them.</li>
<li>After almost 20 years of fighting against extreme odd, the, the colonies of the Colonial Militia finally ended the brutal fighting which had lasted over two generations. This massive victory helped establish an identity with the colonies which would help determine the future of the Militia</li></ul></li>
<li>Colonies that comprised the Militia had a meeting after some rest, discussing plans for advancing forward.
<ul><li>While the alliance had worked for the purposes of fighting the pirates, it had left behind a large trail of destruction and put aside the day-to-day life of the colonies. An unanimous consensus for a reform was present. As a result, the Colonial Militia is planned to be restructured into the <i>Confederated League of Independent Planets</i>, later announced later that year in a very historic speech for CLIP founding planets. This speech is also where the motto <i>"Together, we stand tall against our threats!"</i> comes from.</li>
<li>This era is dominated by the newly-formed GOLD, LAND, and LORD, attempting to rebuild the colonies.
<ul><li>Following a demilitarization effort, the armed forces of the Minutemen downsize considerably during this time.</li>

<ul><li><a href="Maxin.html" title="Maxin">Luna-town, Lanchester City</a>, moons of the Gas Giant Maxin.</li>
<li><a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Serene&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Serene (page does not exist)">Serene</a></li>
<li><a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Ryunosuke&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ryunosuke (page does not exist)">Ryunosuke</a></li>
<li><a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Star_City&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Star City (page does not exist)">Star City</a></li>
<li><a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Clover&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Clover (page does not exist)">Clover</a></li>
<li>... But you can also headcanon your own CLIP planet! We love headcanons, and there's plenty of space to make your own if you wish. You can make your own for your blorbo's lore, if it isn't too out of place tonally, or lore-wise. (eg. CLIP planet that is just Space Russia, USA, or whatnot under a different name, or a planet supposedly bigger than the capitol planet or Lanchester).</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><b>Others, despite not being a uniform culture, probably...</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Think you're a nuisance to their faction's operations in the frontier.</li>
<li>Argue you're either 'keeping the frontier free' or 'making the frontier less free'.</li>
<li>Don't even know that you exist if they are from one of the core planets and don't dabble in politics.</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Playing_a_Member_of_the_League_Minutemen">Playing a Member of the League Minutemen</span></h4>
<p>If you are playing a member of the C-MM, you are a member of the League's armed forces, and though you should expect military roleplay, the C-MM's regulations are far more lax than other militaries.
</p>
<ul><li>You have sworn loyalty to the Colonial League, and that you will defend the colonies against threats both external and internal.</li>
<li>When on-duty, you must keep your uniform on, and recognizable at a glance at all times. So long as your hair fits in your helmet and your uniform's insignia is not obstructed by any accessories, it's fair game.</li>
<li>The details of the hierarchy of the C-MM varies per colony (and sometimes per ship), but it is a constant there there are five rank groups that a member can be part of:</li></ul>
<table class="wikitable">
<caption>
</caption>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Rank Group
</th>
<th>Usual Age (Human)
</th>
<th>Description
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Recruit
</td>
<td>18-20
</td>
<td>Whenever you're training to be a regular soldier in the Minutemen, or studying to become an officer, every member of the League first comes through the rank of Recruit. Green as green can be, the lack of training and responsibility that a Recruit possesses is a great reason to get to know your fellow Minutemen.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Enlistee
</td>
<td>20-30
</td>
<td>The bread and butter of the League. Enlisted members are the most common rank group to belong to, and include Minutemen, Engineers, Corpsmen, Artillerymen, Vehicle Crew, and many other specialized soldiers.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Senior Enlistee
</td>
<td>30-40
</td>
<td>Promoted after multiple years of service, usually 5, Senior Enlisted are the glue between Officers and Enlisted that tie the C-MM together. Many Senior Enlisted have seen their share of both war and peace, and are content with sharing their experiences for the defense of the League.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Officer
</td>
<td>20-40
</td>
<td>Officers form the standard command structure of the League, and tend to be the most varied rank group available, with fresh graduates standing side-to-side with experienced, promoted Senior Enlisted. Officers range from Helmsmen to Captains and specific branch officers. While you don't need higher education to become an Officer in the League, having one allows you to start much younger than many other soldiers.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Senior Officer
</td>
<td>40-60
</td>
<td>At the very top of the hierarchy, Senior Officers are entrusted with the overall direction of the Colonial League's armed components, and as such tend to know the structure of the colonies like the back of their hand. <i>(Note: Under normal circumstances, you shouldn't be a Senior Officer.)</i>
