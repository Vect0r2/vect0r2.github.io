<p>The <b>Confederated League of Independent Planets</b> (shortened to <b>CLIP</b>, and originally <b>the Colonial Militia</b>) is a group of colonies, originating from <a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Zohil&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Zohil (page does not exist)">the United Republics of Free Zohil,</a> that have banded together to form a new faction. While CLIP was initially formed as a ragtag planetary defense force, it has since been remolded into a somewhat coherent government.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Structure">Structure</span></h2>
<p>The League is a mildly militarized, decentralized government. It divides its primary responsibilities into divisions.
</p>
<h3><span id="The_CLIP_Minutemen_.28C-MM.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="The_CLIP_Minutemen_(C-MM)">The CLIP Minutemen (C-MM)</span></h3>
<p>The military arm of the Confederated League of Independent Planets is the <b>CLIP Minutemen</b>. Sometimes nicknamed <i>"Blueberries"</i> for their steel blue uniforms and helmets, the C-MM is in charge of all defensive and offensive military strategy within CLIP.
</p>
<h4><span id="Biohazard_Assessment_and_Removal_Division_.28C-MM-BARD.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Biohazard_Assessment_and_Removal_Division_(C-MM-BARD)">Biohazard Assessment and Removal Division (C-MM-BARD)</span></h4>
<p>A division originally dedicated to the research and removal of Xenofauna. Originating in 422 as the Unknown Threats Division, the UTD researched and fought xenofauna, before rechristening itself as the BARD. While their original goal remains a priority, BARD also prioritizes disease control, and other concerns that might pose a threat to public health.
</p>
<h4><span id="The_Galactic_Optimum_Labor_Division_.28CLIP-GOLD.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Galactic_Optimum_Labor_Division_(CLIP-GOLD)">The Galactic Optimum Labor Division (CLIP-GOLD)</span></h4>
<p>A division formed during the stint of the UTD, the <b>Galactic Optimum Labor Division</b> is a regulatory body designed to ensure colonial autarky, as well as draw funding for the CLIP's governmental branches. Almost every planet in CLIP space has a GOLD Office on it. Considered by many within the league to be a respectable, if not essential part of the Minutemen.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Divisions">Divisions</span></h3>
<h4><span id="Legal_Oversight_and_Regulation_Division_.28CLIP-LORD.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Legal_Oversight_and_Regulation_Division_(CLIP-LORD)">Legal Oversight and Regulation Division (CLIP-LORD)</span></h4>
<p><b>LORD</b> is the civil and legal regulatory organ of the Confederated League. Their line of work ranges from covering rights and responsibilities of citizens to elaboration of conventions and settling land or ownership disputes between colonies.
</p>
<h4><span id="Legislative_Agricultural_Notation_Division_.28CLIP-LAND.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Legislative_Agricultural_Notation_Division_(CLIP-LAND)">Legislative Agricultural Notation Division (CLIP-LAND)</span></h4>
<p>After the conflict with the Frontiersmen pirate fleet, a commission was formed in order to coordinate colony development, especially in the agricultural sense. Eventually, this commission formed into <b>LAND</b>, which branched out its work into colony infrastructure and overall social welfare.
</p>
<h4><span id="Materiel_Engineering_and_Leasing_Division_.28CLIP-MELD.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Materiel_Engineering_and_Leasing_Division_(CLIP-MELD)">Materiel Engineering and Leasing Division (CLIP-MELD)</span></h4>
<p>The origin of <b>MELD</b> lies within the factories of Lanchester City, which manufactured many of the military hardware in use by the C-today. They are often found assisting other divisions with engineering aid.
</p>
<h4><span id="Drug_Evaluation_and_Enhancement_Division_.28CLIP-DEED.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Drug_Evaluation_and_Enhancement_Division_(CLIP-DEED)">Drug Evaluation and Enhancement Division (CLIP-DEED)</span></h4>
<p><b>DEED's</b> focus lies on the research, development and creation of medicine, though shares common ground with the healthcare sector in the Confederated League.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Culture">Culture</span></h2>
<ul><li>The Minutemen lack a unified culture, with most citizens deriving such from local customs and history instead. The lack of a unifying culture is a major disadvantage in the face of encroaching soft power from places such as <a href="../Kalixcis.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Kalixcis">Kalixcis</a>.</li>
<li>That is not to say there is no culture, it is however <a href="#Playing_a_member_of_this_faction"> so varied it is not possible to list it all here. See the <b>Playing a member of this faction</b> section to see each planet's unique culture.</a></li>
<li>Despite this lack of unified culture, a few cultural touchstones have transcended this barrier and have spread across the league:
<ul><li><b>RZNET</b>: An early Zohil-era communications network intended for rapid communication between military units stationed on the frontier. Following the URFZ's retreat, access opened to the public due to the impending danger. While the intended purpose was to rapidly communicate defensive plans and updates to civilian, it developed it's own culture and united the early Colonial Militia. Several posts have gained notoriety due their bizzareness happening during historical moments, including the infamous 'jumpdrive cables' post. It was shut down in FS 423 after it's obvious flaws came to light that it had poor tools for moderation and the newly formed League would have been responsible for moderating it, and also citing that recently developed planetary internet's outclassed it. Many today disagreed with this decision as it meant that CLIP would be left without an Intranet until decades later, also regarded as a reason for CLIP's poor cultural meshing.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Star_City&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Star City (page does not exist)">Time Marches Ever On</a></b>: A show based on the novel "'Time Waits For Nobody'" involving a fantasy setting based on Zale-Era Kalixcis. While starting off tricking the believer to believe it's an adventure show, it kills off what it lures the viewer to believe is the main character by the end of the first episode, and reveals itself to be a political/military drama with a constant focus on the concept of time, with characters aging as time goes on. Notably, the show throws a twist where the novel ends with the narrator being implied to freeze to death in a cliffhanger ending. Instead, the show continues after the cliffhanger, showing that the narrator in fact discovers how to use a plant's energy to create a fire by accidentally spilling a potion on it, surviving and later inventing a laser musket to take on the people who betrayed them. The advancing of time with technology rather than tech staying the same has come to be one of the series's most iconic traits.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Ryunosuke&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ryunosuke (page does not exist)">Sweet New Life</a></b>: A novel based on the founder of Ryunosuke's own experiences coming out of retirement after decades to visit the capital, which has transformed into an alien urban landscape unlike what he remembers. It combines a love for life along with humor to create a surprisingly touching story filled with historical facts, criticisms of modern life, but also agreeing that life now is better than back then. A famous remark was that seeing people living so comfortably made him feel as if his life was worth something.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Serene&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Serene (page does not exist)">Zeir 'ar Shar!</a></b>: A comic that starts off as a comedy on the first colonization attempts with the protagonist being being a extremely patrotic Zohil at first, usually suffering in comedic ways, before the story continues and pivots to something more akin to her finding found family, and realizing that there is more to life than serving one's country. The story ends with the protagonist looking back at all she has helped to build, before an out-of-place spacer with EVA gear on remarks about how the planet is so cold and that nobody would live here, a nod to the story's comedic tone early one. Those who consider the protagist's behavior 'cute' early on usually dislike the shift in tone, and often do not finish reading the entire comic.</li>
<li><b><a href="../Maxin.html" title="Maxin">Nefi Mifime</a></b>: An animated show where a Kepori migrant from the Southern Teceti Combine migrates to Lanchester due to their Mother's business and has to adjust to life there. I'm sorry there isn't anything clever about this, it's generic a slice of life and it's also really popular for some reason. One might either be bewildered that it's popular, consumes it extremely casually and gets suprised when someone talks about it, or be a super fan of it and obsess over it. If one in CLIP doesn't know about it, they definitely know about the fighting over if it's "good' or a "Junk Food Show".</li></ul></li>
<li>While these are not the only cultural touchstones in CLIP, these are however the few that have crossed the boundaries of each member, and are popular everywhere in CLIP short of recently joined planets.</li>
<li>While exaggerated and unrealistic pirate costumes are popular or innocuous in most of the known galaxy, they are considered offensive in the founding colonies of the Minutemen, due to an extensive and unpleasant history with pirate attacks in the colonies.</li>
<li>It is not uncommon to see some armed citizens or Minutemen simply blast those wearing Frontiermsen or Ramzi uniforms on sight with no warning.</li>
<li>Due to the unfortunate history of armed conflict requiring a Milita, CLIP has among the highest civilian to military personnel ration of any faction. While this is for historical reasons, it also to <a href="#Playing_a_member_of_this_faction">meet other people within the league</a>. As a result, the culture on federal or Minutemen ships can range from formal to extremely casual, much to the dismay of PGF advisors. Despite this however, CLIP ships do just as well as other factions in combat situations. This casual culture also leads to bonds occuring between crew members much easier than in other factions, and generally crew members can become lifelong friends.
<ul><li>What I'm trying to say is tone down the milrp several notches as you would on Inteq ships/</li></ul></li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Relations">Relations</span></h2>
<p>Relations with CLIP often differs depending on the member planet, but in general:
</p>
<ul><li>While their relationship has become strained after the ICW, the Minutemen enjoy a <b>generally positive relationship</b> with <a href="../Nanotrasen.html" title="Nanotrasen">Nanotrasen</a>, due to GOLD’s generally laissez-faire attitude towards trade.
<ul><li>This has resulted in a quite large amount of growth within CLIPin the past 100 years, from all the way back when Nanotrasen Electronics establishing stock part manufacturing facilities on CLIP colonies to DeForest Medical establishing several research stations in recent additions to CLIP Minutemen space.</li>
<li>Despite this, GOLD does not back down from fining Nanotrasen in case of felonies. However paradoxically, despite a few severe incidents, Nanotrasen has been allowed to continue operating within CLIP</li></ul></li>
<li>Because of the above, the Syndicate have <b>a varying relationship</b> with the Minutemen.
<ul><li>While some believe that CLIP are aiding Nanotrasen's growth into an ‘evil' megacorporation’, others believe that the Minutemen are standing up to ‘big’ NT.</li></ul></li>
<li>SolCov is <b>neutral</b> to the Minutemen, in traditional Solarian style.</li>
<li>The New Gorlex Republic is very tense towards CLIP, due to their minor support of NT during the ICW and also due to the NGR wishing to keep their independence from most major factions. There is also an anxiety about one day the League will force them to join.
<ul><li>Conversely, CLIP is extremely distrustful of the NGR and watches them intently due to their former status as the Gorlex Marauders, although many realize the Ramzi Clique is the greater threat. Still, there is an uneasy tension between the two factions.</li></ul></li>
<li>The <a href="../Teceti.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Teceti">United Teceti Federation</a> were involved in the terraforming of many member CLIP worlds pre-Zohil collapse. After the Explorat's rise however, they have ignored CLIP for most its history. Recently CLIP has come onto their radar due to their rapid post-ICW expansion. Along with this, CLIP and the TUC have come to an agreement to fund the TUC's terraforming companies to undo the ICW's damage on some newly joined member worlds.</li>
<li>The PGF is allied with CLIP due to various political and historical reasons, most notably due to both's opposition to the Explorat. This relationship has lasted so long that low ranking soldiers are likely to be buddied, but officers and leaders of CLIP are still distrustful, and this distrustfulness goes both ways.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>While CLIP was officially formed in FS-412, their shared history goes back centuries.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Second_Kalixcian_Space_Race"><a href="../Pan-Gezena_Federation.html" title="Pan-Gezena Federation">The Second Kalixcian Space Race</a></span></h3>
<ul><li><b>FS -98</b>
<ul><li>The PGF (Pan-Gezenan Federation) places the first Kalixcian into space. The President of the Federation self-declares the PGF as the winner of the Second Kalixcian Space Race.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS -73</b>
<ul><li>The URFZ (United Republics of Free Zohil) puts the first Kalixcian on a Kalixcian moon, Toitek. Following this breakthrough, the Prime Minister of the Republic, declared that Zohil was the true winner of the space race.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 10</b>
<ul><li>The space race continued, up until when Bezuts was so well explored that the loss of momentum instead caused tensions between both powers. This is widely regarded as the precursor to the Bezuts Systemary War.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 35-38</b>
<ul><li>Bezuts Systemary War. PGF Victory.</li>
<li>Despite the Republic's crippled military due to their the Bezuts Systemary War, it still had a massive advantage in external affairs: their very good relationship with <a href="../Riso-Teceti.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Riso-Teceti">Riso-Teceti</a></li>
<li>Following the war effort by the URFZ, their space agency is put into developing the first bluespace drive to finally meet Tecetians in person - which not only beats the PGF by a landslide, but also extends the advantage the URFZ has over the PGF.</li>
<li>As bluespace technology was developed, the URFZ would soon gain the advantage in trading, as they were generally on good terms with Riso-Teceti.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 150</b>
<ul><li>A colonization frenzy had overtaken every nation in the Kalixcis system, and while the PGF had more mass to show with their massive advances in colonization and military standing, the URFZ's flourishing economy and resource production was more valuable in this regard.</li>
<li>The Federation's reputation had been improving, as their projection of power was easier to see than the URFZ's advantage, and many Zohilians felt as if their government was being 'lazy' in colonizing. While the URFZ was putting in effort into colonizing, the government was in reality waiting for the right moment, and the right moment came in FS-250</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Operation_NanoColonies">Operation <i>NanoColonies</i></span></h3>
<ul><li><b>FS 250</b>
<ul><li>While the PGF were the first to make contact with the <a href="../Most_Serene_Solar_and_Intersolar_Confederation.html" title="Most Serene Solar and Intersolar Confederation">Most Serene Solar and Intersolar Confederation</a> , the URFZ wasted no time in taking advantage of the moment.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 280</b>
<ul><li>Private investors greenlight a venture with Solarian investors to create <a href="../Nanotrasen.html" title="Nanotrasen">Nanotrasen</a>.</li>
<li>Trouble quickly found the newly formed Telecommunications Firm, however, as Etherbor Industries quickly made it virtually impossible to do business within PGF territory, severely limiting their buisness prospects.</li>
<li>Nanotrasen Investors turned to the Zohil Government for help, and an agreement was reached which encompassed the URFZ's plans for not only a massive show of power, but also a profitable one as well, called <b>Operation <i>NanoColonies</i></b>.</li>
<li>The improvements in bluespace techs meant that a region of space previously ignored and rich in phoron and close to the shoal called the Frontier was expected to be the colonization target. While the PGF was busy drawing up plans, the URFZ was already at work.</li>
<li>As apart of Operation NanoColonies, Zohil would work together with <a href="../Riso-Teceti.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Riso-Teceti">Riso-Teceti</a> to rapidly colonize the frontier by a quick but efficient deployment of Teceti's Terraforming corporations, then a colonization team would be sent, and afterwards, Nanotrasen contractors would be sent to build communications infrastructure, along with relocating their headquarters to the colonies once work was finished.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 291</b>
<ul><li>The plan had succeeded far beyond anyone's expectations. Not only were such a massive amount of worlds colonized in such a short amount of time, but Nanotrasen had invented the cutting-edge stock part system during the project, which not only made them extremely more efficent, but made the planet they were given to headquarters in extremely prosperous, and made the investors rich, along with absolutely humiliating the PGF right in front of the Solarians who they so recently contacted.</li>
<li>This region of space would be called the Zohil NanoColonies territory, later renamed Nanotrasen Core Worlds.</li>
<li>Due to Nanotrasen's extreme success, Nanotrasen would purchase colonies surrounding Zohil's core colony for private use.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 300-350</b>
<ul><li>The PGF was starting to colonize the frontier at a reasonable speed, yet Zohil was still extremely far ahead, and has started colonizing the "Zohil Outer Frontier".</li>
<li>The same Operation NanoColonies strategy was used, though progress was slower due to low prioritization.</li>
<li>SolCon's influence over Nanotrasen pressured Nanotrasen to avoid this wave of colonization, though it only managed to slow down the process, not stop it.</li>
<li>Luna-Town was chosen as a base of operations, and the previously colonized Ryunosuke was integrated quickly.</li>
<li>The Zohil Outer Frontier region does very well for itself, not only being well developed, but also being close to the now mega-corporation Nanotrasen.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Explorat-Militia_War">Explorat-Militia War</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>FS 365</b>
<ul><li>Zohil was now awash with political instability. Accusations of corruption and incompetency along with radically different factions with different ideas on how the government would be run, along with a galactic recession, would lie the seeds for the Zohil revolution and civil war.</li>
<li>The URFZ would slowly retreat the military stationed at the Zohil Outer Frontier, leaving the colonies within undefended.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 372</b>
<ul><li>By the time of the projected "temporarily military withdraw" date, morale was at an all-time low, to the point that Zohil vessels and personnel started to desert to stay with the colonies, refusing to head into the Republic's civil war. The deserters would later self-title themselves as the <b>Militia First Fleet.</b></li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS 378</b></li>
<li>As the dust settled and it became clear that the <b>Zohil Explorat</b> was now in control, the Explorat's intent to take back the colonies did not go unnoticed; officers and colony leaders alike quickly scrambled for a plan to defend themselves against a significantly larger force.
<ul><li>While the First Fleet had retrieved arms from the deserting forces, it was determined that resisting an invasion from the Explorat would require a more extensive arming and a conscription of citizens - especially since Nanotrasen had refused to support colonial military efforts. The lack of adequate funding for the colonies made it difficult to acquire arms from established manufacturers, prompting the Fleet to obtain and reverse engineer the recently colonized Illestren's arms, while also focusing on cheap, high-power weapons in order to deal with Zohil's thicker armor, most famously the SKM rifle. Arms of this era were produced in such numbers that they are still circulated on the black market.</li>
<li>Aid was requested from the PGF, but not only was the Federation busy with putting down their own rebellion nearby, the First Fleet was vocally against this. Therefore, the PGF only found it appropriate to send advisors for training purposes.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS-390</b></li>
<li>The Explorat had completely consolidated control, defeated all opposition, and at last, its Naval Forces returned to reclaim the Frontier colonies. While the colonies were sure they would never last a prolonged conflict, they had also made sure that while the Explorat would absolutely suffer while doing so. The resulting conflict would last less than a year.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>FS-391</b></li>
<li>The Explorat had completely failed in reclaiming the colonies due to their loyal forces being severely exhausted and under supplied from the civil war, but also Zohil military units that were inherited from the republic were severely demoralized by the shift in power.
<ul><li>Realizing that this conflict would take longer than expected and also waste resources better spent on recovering after the civil war, the leaders of the Explorat would finally withdraw, for good this time.</li>
<li>The colonies and First Fleet held against an overwhelming force, but at a tremendous cost. While the Explorat may have suffered from severe issues which prevented their success, they were still much better equipped technologically than the colonies, and many milita personnel and equipment were killed or destroyed.</li></ul></li>
<li>After this, what remained of the first fleet and local colonial forces agreed on unifying, creating an alliance named the <b>Colonial Militia.</b> All members of the Colonial Militia would later be the founding members of the Colonial League.
<ul><li>The Zohil Explorat, defeated and humiliated, removes its capital from Kalixcis, and takes an isolationist policy on the rest of the galaxy. While the Explorat-Militia War wasn't the only reason, <a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Zohil&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Zohil (page does not exist)">it's the only one relevant to this article</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>Unfortunately, chance would not be kind to the newly formed militia, as an ambitious pirate fleet happened to emerge from the shoal just 10 years prior, and had taken noticed of the severely weakened colonies.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Frontiersman_War">The Frontiersman War</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>FS-392</b>
<ul><li>Pirates, taking advantage of the now-weakened stance of these colonies, rapidly sprung up in the region, and had begun conducting extensive raids on colonies, notably the <a href="../Frontiersmen.html" title="Frontiersmen">Old Frontiersmen</a>.
<ul><li>The Frontiersmen had made a name for themselves by a particularly brutal strategy of attacking other pirates, executing the leadership, and keeping the crew alive to expand their fleet. The sheer amount of manpower available to the fleet had begun intimidating pirate captains began to join the Frontiersmen.</li>
<li>The militias, while adequate at staving off small pirate crews, were completely overwhelmed by the massive and mostly-organized Frontiersmen pirate fleet.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS-395</b>
<ul><li>During a particularly intense raid, the militia of <a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Radinska&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Radinska (page does not exist)">Radinska</a> is wiped out following a coordinated pirate flank on the populated areas of the colony.</li>
<li>Captain Rawkkriiiehkhaka, rather than ransacking the colony, decides to seize control.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>FS-396</b>
<ul><li>Following a streak of defeats and losses for the colonies, the Luna-Town militia, desperate and severely lacking in supplies, had struck gold while looking for salvage to employ in the defensive effort.
<ul><li>A vessel, seemingly plain scrap, was located, and within it a large cache of equipment, including multiple, extremely-old yet intact models of P16s, blue ballistic helmets with white markings, and miscellaneous materiel and training documents were encountered by the team. The vessel’s markings had long faded away, making the vessel’s origin a mystery, but it was later called the <i>UNSV Lichtenstein</i> by various colonists.</li></ul></li>
<li>Later that year, two Frontiersmen cruisers are sent to attempt to wipe out and potentially capture the planet.
<ul><li>Due to the various victories achieved by the fleet previously and the poor equipment of previously encountered Colonial Militia, the cruisers attempts a confident lighting attack towards the colony.</li>
<li>The popular Battle of Luna-Town lasted about 3 hours, from the landing of the vessel to the retreat of the second ship. Following the cruiser's landing and an interrupted march into Luna-Town, an urban ambush by Militia forces catch the pirate line off-guard. Usage of the equipment found on the <i>UNSV Lichtenstein</i> created a massive advantage for the defending forces.</li>
<li>After the Militia on Luna-Town wins a decisive victory and seizes the landed pirate ship, CLIP's accounts of the battle claims that the Frontiersmen that were evacuated to the other cruiser in orbit were shot down in, roughly, a minute. News of this victory spread far and wide throughout the colonies, granting some hope to the besieged. Hoping to still catch the pirates off guard, the Planet of <a href="https://shiptest.net/w/index.php?title=Lanchester_City&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lanchester City (page does not exist)">Lanchester City</a> is retaken by colonial forces.</li>
<li>The slang term “Minutemen” was coined after the highly-inspiring story of the pirate ship that got shot down in a single minute, and not after militias ready at a minute's notice.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>FS-402</b>
<ul><li>After replicating and distributing the newly found equipment, the Luna-Town Militia becomes a major player in the war, removing many planets and colonies from control of the Frontiersmen fleet.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>the next 10 years are misc war fighting and stuff, the usual war stuff like death and shooting and explosions and probably the usual warcrimes</i></li>
<li><i>You ever see mobile suit gundam 79? It was kinda like that, but with less mechs and infantry/naval combat.</i></li>
<li>From a military standpoint but quickly so we don't bore the people who don't care about that:
<ul><li>The Old Frontiersmen were unprepared for a Milita recovery, and their high morale due to the rapid chain of victories. Furthermore, the Frontiersmen fleet were specialized in quick hit-and-run operations, requiring mobility and momentum, which ultimately led to their eventual demise.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>FS-412:</b>
<ul><li>The final remainders of the Frontiersmen are confronted in their sector of operations. By this time, the fleet had been driven to exhaustion via an extensive siege, and remaining forces had begun deserting the fleet. A rather anti-climatic final attack landed the final nail in the coffin for the Frontiersmen. Captain Rawkkriiiehkhaka would be killed on the FFV Rawkkriiiehkhaka, and sadly the answers to the many mysteries of the Frontiersmen would go along with them.</li>
<li>After almost 20 years of fighting against extreme odd, the, the colonies of the Colonial Militia finally ended the brutal fighting which had lasted over two generations. This massive victory helped establish an identity with the colonies which would help determine the future of the Militia</li></ul></li>
<li>Colonies that comprised the Militia had a meeting after some rest, discussing plans for advancing forward.
<ul><li>While the alliance had worked for the purposes of fighting the pirates, it had left behind a large trail of destruction and put aside the day-to-day life of the colonies. An unanimous consensus for a reform was present. As a result, the Colonial Militia is planned to be restructured into the <i>Confederated League of Independent Planets</i>, later announced later that year in a very historic speech for CLIP founding planets. This speech is also where the motto <i>"Together, we stand tall against our threats!"</i> comes from.</li>
<li>This era is dominated by the newly-formed GOLD, LAND, and LORD, attempting to rebuild the colonies.
<ul><li>Following a demilitarization effort, the armed forces of the Minutemen downsize considerably during this time.</li>
<li>Many of the civilian divisions, especially GOLD, were expanded upon in the next 20 years.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<li>One of the first factions to recognize CLIP was the PGF, who were not only impressed at CLIP for surviving against massive odds, but were looking for new allies on the frontier against Zohil. Treaties and trade agreements are signed which eventually leads into two forming an important alliance later on.</li>
<li><b>FS-418:</b></li>
<li>CLIP and the PGF finally formalize the alliance, and the PGF sends patrol ships to help hunt down the Frontiersmen Remnants.
<ul><li>While it is suspected that the Explorat was arming the Frontiersmen Remnants to weaken the two, the Frontiersmen Remnants were far too de-moralized and weakened at this point to continue fighting, leading some to suspect that this is a false rumor.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>On advice from one of the PGFN's fleet admirals, the C-MM (military arm of CLIP) announces that they wish to modernize the ancient Lichtenstein-era designs and half-century old Zohil equipment that were in use.

<ul><li>CLIP, being a collection of multiple colonies who have faced many different experiences, gives the League a extremely decentralized nature. One person from one planet will be completely different from another person from another planet. Enlisting is often a common way of meeting others in the CLIP alliance.</li>
<li>It is recommended you make a character from one of the following places:

<p>If you are playing a member of the C-MM, you are a member of the League's armed forces, and though you should expect military roleplay, the C-MM's regulations are far more lax than other militaries.

<ul><li>You have sworn loyalty to the Colonial League, and that you will defend the colonies against threats both external and internal.</li>

<td>The bread and butter of the League. Enlisted members are the most common rank group to belong to, and include Minutemen, Engineers, Corpsmen, Artillerymen, Vehicle Crew, and many other specialized soldiers.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Senior Enlistee
</td>
<td>30-40
</td>
<td>Promoted after multiple years of service, usually 5, Senior Enlisted are the glue between Officers and Enlisted that tie the C-MM together. Many Senior Enlisted have seen their share of both war and peace, and are content with sharing their experiences for the defense of the League.

<tr>
<td>Officer
</td>
<td>20-40
</td>
<td>Officers form the standard command structure of the League, and tend to be the most varied rank group available, with fresh graduates standing side-to-side with experienced, promoted Senior Enlisted. Officers range from Helmsmen to Captains and specific branch officers. While you don't need higher education to become an Officer in the League, having one allows you to start much younger than many other soldiers.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Senior Officer
</td>
<td>40-60
</td>
<td>At the very top of the hierarchy, Senior Officers are entrusted with the overall direction of the Colonial League's armed components, and as such tend to know the structure of the colonies like the back of their hand. <i>(Note: Under normal circumstances, you shouldn't be a Senior Officer.)</i>
